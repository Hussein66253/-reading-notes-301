With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes a question which is: **how to build websites suitable for all users?**. The industry response to this question has become ***responsive web design***, also known as **RWD**.
# Responsive Web Design
## What does Responsive mean in web design?
- Responsive design is an approach to web page creation that makes use of *flexible layouts*, *flexible images* and *cascading style sheet media queries*. The **goal** of responsive design is to **build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and change the layout accordingly.**

- The term itself was coined, and largely developed, by **Ethan Marcotte** and his book about [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) worth a read.
### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
#### What is adaptive and responsive design?  
- **Responsive design** is smooth because the layout fluidly adjusts *regardless of what device* it is viewed on.   
- **Adaptive design**, on the other hand, snaps into place because the page is serving something different *because of the browser or device it is viewed on.*
#### What is adaptive and responsive design?  
-  When a website is **responsive**, the layout and/or content responds or adapts *based on the size of screen* they are presented on, a responsive website **automatically** changes to fit the device we're reading it on.  

 Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including **flexible layouts, media queries**, and **flexible media**.  
 1. **What is flexible layout?**  
     -  Flexible layout is approach to page layout attempts to accommodate the diversity of display environments Rather than serving only the *most common* display dimensions and the *typical* user, a flexible layout adapts to different viewing.

## Float
- **CSS float** is a property that forces any element to float *right, left, none, inherit* inside its parent body with the rest of the element to wrap around it this property can be used to place an image or an element inside its container and other inline elements will wrap around it.  
**Clearing the Float**  
Float's sister property is **clear** an element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.
