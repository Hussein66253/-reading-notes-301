# jQuery
- #### What is jQuery and why it is used?

- *jQuery* is a lightweight, *write less, do more*, JavaScript library. The purpose of *jQuery* is to make it much **easier** to use JavaScript on your website. *jQuery* takes a lot of common tasks that require **many lines of JavaScript**code to accomplish, and wraps them into *methods* that you can call with a **single line of code**.    
- The *jQuery* syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s), Basic syntax is:         
    > $(selector).action() 

1. A **$** sign to access *jQuery*. 
2. A **(selector)** to *query HTML elements*. 
3. A jQuery **action()** to be *performed* on the element(s).
- We can simply use the jQuery  
1. **text()** method to get all the text content inside an element.
2. **append()** method is used to *insert* content to the *end* of the selected elements.
3. **prepend()** method is used to *insert* content to the *beginning* of the selected elements.
4. **before()** method is used to *insert* content *before* the selected elements.
5. **after()** method is used to *insert* content *after* the selected elements.
## Pair Programming
- pair programming is: where **two** **developers** work using only **one machine**, each one has a keyboard and a mouse, one acts as the *driver* who codes while the other will serve as the *navigator* who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next, these roles can be switched at any time the *driver* will then become the *navigator* and so on.    
##### Pair Programming Advantages
1. **More efficient:**Common thinking is that it slows down the project completion time because we are effectively putting two programmers to develop a single program,
2. **Fewer coding mistakes:** Because there is another programmer looking over our work.    
3. **Two heads are better than one:** If the driver encounters a hitch with the code, there will be two of them whoâ€™ll solve the problem
