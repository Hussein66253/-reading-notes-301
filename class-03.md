## JavaScript templating
- JavaScript templating refers to the *client side* data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language. it became popular because of **JavaScript's** **increased use**, its increase in client processing capabilities, and the trend to outsource computations to the client's web browser. 
## Mustache
Mustache is described as a *logic-less* system because it lacks *any explicit control flow statements*, like *if* and *else* conditionals or *for loops*.   

- It is named **Mustache** because of heavy use of **braces { }**. 
        
        Mustache.render(stay, {{place}}‚Äù, { place: home });   // returns: stay, home
    
- In the above, we see **two braces** around *place*. This is **Mustache syntax** to show that it is a *placeholder*. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the **place** property in the object we pass in, and replace *place* with the actual value, e,g, **home**.
## Flexbox
- **What is use of Flexbox in CSS?**    

- Flexbox is a *layout model* that allows elements to **align and distribute space** within a container, using flexible widths and heights, elements can be aligned to fill a space or distribute space between elements, which makes it a great tool to use for **responsive** design systems.
