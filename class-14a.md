# Database Normalization
**- What is normalization in a database?**
- **Normalization** is the process of *organizing* data in a database. This includes *creating tables* and *establishing relationships* between those tables according to rules designed both to **protect** the data and to make the database more **flexible** by eliminating redundancy and *inconsistent* *dependency*.
**- What is the purpose of normalization?**
- The **main** purpose of *normalization* is to **minimize** the *redundancy* and r*emove Insert, Update* and *Delete* Anomaly, it *divides* *larger tables* to *smaller tables* and **links** them using relationships
- *Data redundancy* happens when the same piece of data is **held** in **two separate place**.
- There are three types of Data Anomalies: **Update Anomalies**, **Insertion Anomalies**, and **Deletion Anomalies**.
